#### Note

##### Queries enclosed in double quotes are searched as is

- `ho ge` matches both `ho ge` and `hoge`

Ex: If there are three files.

- hoge.md
- hoge
- mdhoge

`hoge -md` suggests only `hoge`.

    - `"ho ge"` only matches `ho ge` not `hoge`
    - `ho ge` matches both `ho ge` and `hoge`

## Appendix

### What is the "2-hop-link"?

[2-hop-link] are outgoing links in the current file, and files that have outgoing links to them.

For example, If there are relations as follows,

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    D[Dog] --> A[Animal]
    C[Cat] --> A
    O[Owl] --> A
```

[2-hop-link] from the "Dog" is as follows.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    D[Dog]:::focus --> A[Animal]
    D[Dog]:::focus --> C[Cat]
    D[Dog]:::focus --> O[Owl]
    
    classDef focus fill:#f96
```

More complicated example.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Dog:::focus --> Animal
    Dog --> Masaru
    Zagitova --> Masaru
    Masaru --> Akita-inu
    Cat --> Animal
    Owl --> Animal
    Tama --> Cat
    Mike --> Cat
    Animal --> Zoo
    Zoo --> Animal
    Mahjong --> Zoo
    Animal --> Coffee
    classDef focus fill:#f96
```

[2-hop-link] from the "Dog" is as follows.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Dog:::focus --> Animal:::focus
    Dog --> Masaru:::focus
    Zagitova:::focus --> Masaru
    Masaru --> Akita-inu
    Cat:::focus --> Animal
    Owl:::focus --> Animal
    Tama --> Cat
    Mike --> Cat
    Animal --> Zoo
    Zoo:::focus --> Animal
    Mahjong --> Zoo
    Animal --> Coffee
    classDef focus fill:#f96
```
